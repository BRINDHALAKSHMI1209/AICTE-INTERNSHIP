Potatoes are one of the most important crops worldwide, providing food and income for millions of people. However, they are susceptible to various diseases that can significantly reduce yield and quality. Detecting these diseases early is crucial for effective management and control. This report focuses on the detection of potato leaf diseases, aiming to provide a clear understanding of the problem, the motivation behind the study, the objectives, and the proposed methodology for disease detection.
The problem of potato leaf diseases is significant. Farmers often struggle to identify diseases in their crops until it is too late, leading to substantial losses.

1.2	Motivation: 
I chosed this project because I’m currently working on another project similar to this with the help of my teammates so that motivated me to do this project.
1.3	Objective: 
To develop an efficient and accurate system for detecting and classifying diseases in potato leaves using image processing and machine learning techniques. The system aims to analyze leaf images to identify signs of diseases such as late blight, early blight, and other infections, enabling early intervention and improved crop health.
1.4	Scope of the Project: 
•  Detect common potato leaf diseases such as Late Blight, Early Blight, and Bacterial Wilt.
•  Classify leaves as healthy or diseased using image processing and machine learning techniques.
